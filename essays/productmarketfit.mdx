title: The Product-Market-Fit Myth.
abstract: Product-market-fit is an overused term that is never well defined and bluntly overrated at the beginning stages of a startup. Product market fit is not enough to build a successful startup. Many can find products that a least some people want, however, most startups are still unsuccessful. The product-market fit equation should be very closely tied to growth. No matter how great your product is and how big your market is, if you are unable to capture the market.

## The Common Attitude

Most argue that product-market-fit is the most important factor in a startup. Marc Andressen suggests that once product-market-fit is found, you are just going to know it as your company would be in a great state. On the other hand, there are many products that in reality are very poorly built, but are multi-billion dollar companies. Oracle in this day and age I would say is a prime example.

## The Binary Problem

Going back to Marc Andressen, Andressen states that when you have found a product-market-fit you are just going to know it. However, that implies that product-market-fit is a binary. You either know that you have it or you don't.

Product-market-fit is not a binary at all. Product-market-fit is very similar to NPS. A product that others would go out of their way to suggest to others is a product that has found product-market-fit. This means that you have to continuously integrate the product such that more and more people recommend it to others. Moreover, another measure of product-market-fit is retention. You can conduct all sorts of surveys asking users how much they like your product, but if their time of use does not show it, it is worthless.

## The Product/Distribution Problem

Building a great product is not the answer to the startup problem. Building a great product is a piece of having a successful startup but is nowhere near the whole pie. A contrarian view would say that distribution of the product is many times more important than the product itself. With an amazing distribution channel, you can sell the worst product. Without a distribution channel, you will never be able to sell the best possible product.

Everyone has taken the approach that product-market-fit is the holy grail for startups yet it is far from the answer for most startups. Even with the best NPS and amazing retention, distribution will always be the key to a fast-growing startup.

## The Ideal Fit

The ideal scenario in your startup is a great product coupled with a great distribution method. Depending on the price of your service/product and the target audience, different distribution methods should be used. You want to consistently be working on better NPS, and retention while distributing the product as best as possible.

## What to Think About

What is the best possible distribution method for your product/service?

How can I improve the product such that my users will say on my product longer, and begin to love the product so much that they would recommend it to their friends?

How can I make my distribution channel cohesive with my product and the market in general?
