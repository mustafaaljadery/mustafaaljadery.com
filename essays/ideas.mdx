title: The Paradox of Excellent Startup Ideas.
abstract: Contrary to popular startup belief, the startup idea is one of the most important aspects of the startup. The biggest risk startups face is not product, distribution, community, etc. The biggest risk is moving in the wrong direction. Your sole focus as a startup founder should be providing VALUE to your users. In this essay, I discuss what it means to provide values for your users, and I propose a scale in which you can judge the worth of a startup idea.

## What is Value and Where Does it Come From?

To understand value first one must understand where value originates from. Value is a very important concept in microeconomics and it is the marginal utility of a service or object. If I like apples and I have some money, I might pay $3 for an apple. If I didn't like apples, I wouldn't pay anything. If I liked apples and many people were offering the same apple for different prices, I would converge to the lowest offering. Thus value is predicated around perception and supply and demand (with connection to time).

The value of the product or service offered to another individual is equal to the best possible outcome that can be achieved with the least amount of sacrifice.

## NPS and Large Markets

Definition

- Net Promoter Score: Your net promoter score is a score from 1 to 10 measuring how likely it is that someone would recommend your product to someone else.

The best ideas come from markets that are already large but have a low NPS. It means that the product is inefficient, if you can make a better product you will win the market. This itself is a contrarian idea as this implies that the size of the market is the most important in contrast to the startup team.

## Idea 1: Understanding the changing perspectives of others

Understanding the changing perspectives of our culture is fundamental to understanding what to build. Below are some common trends that I've realized have infected our culture.

#### The Merge of Culture and Commerce.

- Culture is no longer opposed to commerce. Most companies focus on the integration of culture and commerce to give the end consumer a natural feeling which is within his/her interest.

#### The Evolution of Capitalism.

- A profit-hungry person is looked down upon in modern society. Every single dollar that a company earns must serve the purpose of a better humanity. Pure greed is not only looked down upon, it is prone to all sorts of mischaracterizations and legal battles.

#### Quality vs Quantity

- Many have lost the desire for quantity. The focus in this day and age is quality. Back when life was harder, the quantity was everyone anyone cared about, but in the simple and highly stimulated lives of people nowadays, they look for the highest regarded product. You must pay attention to all detail to make your product the best it can be.

#### The Metaphysical Counterpart

- With the steep decline of religion, many have turned to the metaphysical and spiritual. Everyone needs meaning in life and with less trust in "outdated" religious ideology, many are looking for comfort in subsequent beliefs.

#### Information Retrieval

- Before the age of google, a brain acted as a database of pointers to chunks of information. However, after the growth of search engines, information placement is no longer the interest of the people, but rather the compilation of the information. Knowledge in this day and age is extremely highly regarded. Don't provide information about your product to others but rather educate them on why they should care. Make sure they leave having learned something new.

#### The Availability of Money

- Money is more available than it has ever been. A $3000 luxury product has lost its value as more and more people can now afford this product. There must evolve a new form of luxury.

#### Transparency

- The fastest way to lose the trust of people is to hide something. Reputation is more crucial in this day and age than it has ever been. The internet has allowed for anonymity and has paid for it with billions of dollars in yearly fraud and security breaches. The more credible a person, the more likely they are to get business.

## Idea 2: Putting Yourself In Other People's Shoes.

The best way to think about startup ideas is to consult Game Theory. It is essential in game theory to attempt to understand the reward functions of your opponents. What is my opponent's strategy? In essence, you want to understand your opponents' strategy as best as you can in order for you to construct your strategy.

This applies deeply to startups and especially ideas for startups. You want to know the specific actions that prompt a user to use/buy your product. You want to look for trends in the actions of people.

For example, there is a growing rate of people that want to become entrepreneurs. The world is slowly becoming more desensitized to the idea of formal education and corporate structure. Since this is a growing marketing and a rising trend, a good product maybe something useful to them. (this essay achieves this to a degree)

## Deceptive Ideas

When judging ideas, you want good ideas that look like bad ideas. This is how every large company has been built. Big companies are already working hard on good ideas and you are in no position to be competing with them. Thus you want to know something that other people don't about an industry. If you know your problem better than anyone else, you will win.

One of the best ways to find such ideas is to look at what people are spending the most time on and figure out if you can build a solution that does it faster.

## Picture of the Future.

When looking at the value that a company provides you should look into the future. You want it such that if your service is successful, people live a life they want to live in the future. You can reason that anything that provides even the slightest amount of value is good for the future, however, in a lot of scenarios, people don't want that to be their future. If everyone on earth studies theoretical physics we would know more about the universe, however, that is not a life many people want to live. Just because your product provides value does not mean others want such a form of value.

## Judging an Idea

To judge an idea you must judge the value it outputs and the overall consensus around the idea. The ideal product should provide a lot of value to its users and make the users love their product.

## After the Idea

Once you have recognized an opportunity you must do serious homework. You need to spend a tremendous amount of effort and time researching the market. Your biggest fear as a startup should be the fear of moving in the wrong direction. You must do your homework on customer behavior and you must understand that it is not easy to change customer behavior, as a result, is this one of the areas that your startup should not be innovating in.

## Questions to think about

What are more people doing today that was uncommon a year/decade ago? Is there a large market that is underdeveloped?

What do I know about this market that others don't?

Is the market ready for what I am about to release, is there already a growing interest in such technology?

Can you unbundle grouped values? How can I make people a product that they love?
