title: The Metaphysical Product.
abstract: Go read everything you want about startups and the first statement will always be to build a product that solves a problem. "You should never begin at the solution." However, taking a look at Bernard Arnault's empire, he has amassed a fortune of over $150 billion with products that solve no problem. Louis Vuitton sells handbags for thousands of dollars when any competitor can outsource the same function of a product for a couple of dollars.

## What is the Metaphysical Product?

The Metaphysical product is a product that provides value mentally to the user instead of physically. Through all sorts of psychological and seductive techniques, the founder of the product convinces his/her users that the product is worth more than it is. As a user, you are convinced what you are paying for is worth much more than the physical attributes while the owner of such product leaves with a large gross profit margin.

## The Velvet Rope

The main strategy employed by companies that focus on the metaphysical is exclusivity. A simple microeconomic concept. The lower the perceived supply of an object, the more desirable the object. The key here is to make your product be perceived as of low supply but sell as much as you want. Casinos do this by tricking your brain that a slot spin is either a win or a loss, 50/50, however, your odds of winning are a tiny fraction.

## The Seductive Seller

You want your product to be seductive. Users of your product are of a better caliber than other humans. If you carry a Louis Vuitton bag, you are of a higher class and have better taste than that with the JanSport backpack. If you when to school at Stanford you are smarter than that who went to a state school. These are myths when thinking about them objectively. Isaac Newton did not create a certain set of gravitational laws for Stanford students to study and a certain set for your state schools. However, you want your product to seem like it is better, just like how Stanford makes you (and others) think you are smarter if you have studied there.

## The Myth Builder

Have you ever asked yourself what the most valuable company in the entire world is? If you go look at public company market caps, you are looking in the wrong place. The best two companies in history are Christianity and Islam. The Mormon Church (a subsidiary of Christianity) generates $6 billion a year in donations. To put that into context the Mormon Church only consists of about 14 million members. Another subsidiary of Christianity is Catholicism and which consists of 1.3 billion members. Imagine a company generating billions of dollars in recurring cash flow whilst having a single physical product, a book (The Bible).

What religions do best is they craft narratives that let people believe they know and know why they believe. It is the ultimate seductiveness. You are a group of people that truly understands what is going on in the world while all the other people are moving through the world hopelessly. People must see your dream and must resonate with it. A life like this is a life I want to live.

## Living the Dream

It is not enough to tell others about the dream of your product, you must live the dream. If your marketed dream to others is of superior design and better engineering, your product must never show anything that lacks in design or contains bugs. The hardest task with creating a metaphysical product is living the dream. The best brands NEVER EVER compromise their dream. You will never see Louis Vuitton on discounts, a buyer looking for discounts is not the intended buyer of Louis Vuitton. You have to define the elements that are essential to the brand's myth and mission and radiate them from the inside out. You must craft an experience that allows your users to truly experience the myth. Louis Vuitton fashion shows radiate this perfectly. An arena that looks like an art piece with supermodels wearing their products. They make you believe that their product is of a higher class.

## What to Think About

Is my product seducing my users? Is what I am advertising playing with their head?

Do the users the use my product think of it as a commodity? Will they switch if someone brings on a product with a lower price?

What is the dream that I am selling? How am I living out the dream? How are my users living out the dream?
