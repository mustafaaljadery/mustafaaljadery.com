title: The Paradox of Excellent Startup Ideas.
abstract: Contrary to popular startup belief, the startup idea is one of the most important aspects of the startup. The biggest risk startups face is not product, distribution, community, etc. The biggest risk is moving in the wrong direction. Your sole focus as a startup founder should be providing VALUE to your users. In this essay, I discuss what it means to provide values for your users, and I propose a scale in which you can judge the worth of a startup idea.

## Startups and the introduction to value.

A startup at it's basic form is an organization of likeminded people whose plan it is to solve a certain problem in the world. All successful startups revolve around the idea of value: the usefulness of some product. A product that provides incredible value to others will almost always find a way to make money. When judging ideas in a startup the one metric should be value, how much value am I providing the other person, and how can I increase the value. Monetization follows the value problem.

## Value and Alex Hormozi and Big Markets

To understand value first one must understand where value originates from. Value is a very important concept in microeconomics and it is the marginal utility of a service or object. If I like apples and I have some money, I might pay $3 for an apple. If I didn't like apples, I wouldn't pay anything. If I liked apples and many people were offering the same apple for different prices, I would converge to the lowest offering. Thus value is predicated around perception and supply and demand (with connection to time).

The value of the product or service offered to another individual is equal to the best possible outcome that can be achieved with the least amount of sacrifice. (Exact equation at the end of the essay.)

## NPS and Large Markets

Another contrarian idea is the idea that markets dicate the value of the initial idea of the startup in contrast to the team.

## Find Idea 1: Understanding the changing perspectives of others

Understanding the changing perspectives of our culture is fundamental to understanding what to building. Below are some common trends that I've realized has infected our culture.

#### The merge of Culture and Commerce.

- Culture is no longer opposed to commerce. Most companies focus on integration culture and commerce in order to give the end consumer a natural feeling which is within his/her interest.

#### The evolution of Capitalism.

- A profit hungry person is looked down upon in modern society. Every single dollar that a company earns must serve the purpose of a better humanity. Pure greed is not only look down upon, it is prone to all sorts mischaracterizations and legal battles.

#### Quality vs Quantity

- Many have lost the desire of quantity. The focus in this day and age is quality. Back when life was harder, quantity was everyone anyone cared about, but in the simple and highly stimulated lives of people nowadays, they look for the highest regarded product. You must pay attention to all detail to make your product the best it can be.

#### The metaphysical counterpart

- With the steep decline of religion, many have turn to the metaphyical and spiritual. Everyone needs meaning in life and with less trust with "outdated" religious ideology, many are looking for comfort in subsequent beliefs.

#### Information retrieval

- Before the age of google, a brain acted as a database of pointers to chuncks of information. However, after the growth of search engines, information placement is no longer the interest of the people, but rather the compilation of the information. Knowledge in this day and age is extremely highly regarded. Don't provide information about your product to other but rather education them on why they should care. Make sure they leave having learned something new.

#### The availability of Money

- Money is more available than it has ever been. A $3000 luxury product has lost its value as more and more people can now afford this product. There must evolve a new form of luxury.

### Transparency

- The fastest way to lose the trust of people is to hide something. Reputation is more crucial in this day and age than it has ever been. The internet has allowed for anonymity and has paid for it with billion of dollars in yearly fraud and security breaches. The more credible a person, the more likely they are to get business.

## Find Idea 2: Putting yourself in other people's shoes.

- The best way to think about startup ideas is to consult Game Theory. It is essential in game theory to attempt to understand the reward functions of your opponents. What is my opponents strategy? In essense you want to understand your opponents strategy as best as you can in order for your to construct your own strategy.

- This applies deeply to startups and especially ideas for startups. You want to know the specific actions that prompt a user to use/buy your product. You want to look for trends in the actions of people.

- For example, there is a growing rate of people that want to become entreprenurs. The world is slowly becoming more desensitized to the idea of formal education and corporate structure. Since this is a growing marketing and a rise trend, a good product may be something that is useful to them. (this essay achieves this to a degree)

- A example building upon my last statement is the surge of people selling all sorts of Dropshipping, Amazon FBA, Social Media Marketing courses. Although I believe that selling such things is unethical and unproductive to humanity, there is a clear demand in the market. Many people are buying courses of 19 year old kids for thousands of dollars selling them a get rich quick scheme. If instead your build a tool that allows people to maybe track their relationships with other businesses, or help with the legal work of starting a business (actually providing value to people) you might be on the brink of a successful startup.

## Deceptive Ideas

- There are very few good startup ideas out of the box. None of the highest ra

## How Can I find ideas?

- Again a startup is just an organizaiton of

## Thinking of Startups strategically.


- Think about the daily schedule of people, what is taking a long time and how can I optimize it. This is what amazon, google, etc did.
- How can I give people more variety to what they want.
- How can I make people a product that they love.
